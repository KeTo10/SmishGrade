# SmishGrade: Smishing URL Detection Framework

SmishGrade is a heuristics-based framework for smishing detection. SmishGrade analyzes **only the URL string** using a graded heuristic engine.

This project was developed as a **Capstone Project** in Cybersecurity at Fordham University.

## About

SMS phishing (smishing) often utilizes ephemeral infrastructure and "cloaking" techniques to evade detection. SmishGrade addresses this by avoiding webpage content analysis completely. Instead, it assigns a risk score based on observable lexical, host-based, and DNS-based characteristics of the URL.
